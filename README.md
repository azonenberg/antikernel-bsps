# antikernel-bsps

Board support files for Antikernel using Splash.

Support for additional dev boards is welcome.

## Conventions

All boards must provide a clock source called "clk" which may be used to source core clocks from. This clock must be
running at reset and not require any configuration to use.

TODO: Add more standardization here
